## Playing with Axes
###   1.	Move the x-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the x-axis assembly.
###   2.	Move the y-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the y-axis assembly.
###   3.	Move the z-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z-axis assembly.

## OUTPUT
###  X AXIS ASSEMBLY

#### SMOOTH ROD
It is guide rail component made up of hardened-steel or chrome plated steel .it smoothness ensures precise  and consistent movement which is needed to produce accurate and high quality models.

#### BEARING 
Linear bearings are typically used in conjunction with smooth rods,they are used to reduce friction . linear motion and rotational motion-ball bearing.

#### IDLER
The idler pulley  helps to guide the belt along its path, reducing the chances of the belt slipping or jumping teeth and causing print defects.

#### EXTRUDER
Extruder is used to melting and extruding the filament onto the print bed.

#### MOTOR
motor is help to movement of the print head along x,y,z axes.

### Y AXIS ASSEMBLY

#### Y-AXIS SUPPORTER
The Y-axis supporter must be designed to withstand the forces generated during printing and maintain the printer's accuracy and stability. 

#### HORIZ & THREADED ROD
The horizontal threaded rod is typically used to hold the pulley that drives the movement of the print bed along the Y-axis.The vertical threaded rod is typically used to control the Z-axis movement of the print bed.

#### SMOOTH ROD 
The use of smooth rods in the printer's Y-axis mechanism helps to provide smooth and precise movement of the print bed

#### PULLEY
pulley is often used in the Y-axis mechanism to transfer motion from the printer's stepper motor to the print bed.

#### MOTOR
motor is help to movement of the print head along x,y,z axes.

#### Y AXIS FRAME 
It is responsible for support and stability of y axis frame.and also z axis.

#### Y AXIS BASE
The Y-axis base is responsible for providing stability and support to the entire printer's structure, including the Y-axis frame, the print bed, and the printed object.

###  Z AXIS ASSEMBLY

#### Z AXIS ROD 
The z-axis rod is responsible for supporting the weight of the print head and controlling its movement as it moves up and down during the printing process.

### Z AXIS TOP COVER 
The primary purpose of the z-axis top cover is to prevent dust and debris from settling on the z-axis rod, which can cause damage to the rod and the bearings that guide it

####  MOTOR 
motor is help to movement of the print head along x,y,z axes.

 #### FRAME 
 rigid structure that holds all the other components of the printer
 
 #### Y AXIS ASSEMBLY 
 The Y-axis is responsible for moving the print bed back and forth along the horizontal axis.
 
 #### Z AXIS ASSEMBLY 
 The Z-axis is responsible for moving the print head up and down along the vertical axis.
 
 #### X AXIS ASSEMBLY
 The X-axis is responsible for moving the print head back and forth along the horizontal axis
 
 #### SMPS 
 convert ac to dc current.
 
 #### LCD 
 LCD screen provides a user-friendly interface that allows the user to control the printer and monitor its progress during printing
 
 #### SPOOL HOLDER
 It holds spool
 
 #### SPOOL 
 a spool refers to a roll of filament that is used as the printing material for the 3D printer.
